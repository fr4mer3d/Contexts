## Key Community Insights for Mac Users

### The 24" 4K Sweet Spot
Community consensus is strong: 24" 4K monitors at 3840x2160 resolution provide perfect 2x pixel-perfect scaling on M-series Macs. This is described as the "good zone" - not too large native, not too small scaled. Community experience shows ~185 PPI density is "noticeable less than MacBook displays but not objectionable."

### 1440p Native Resolution - AVOID
Mac communities strongly advise against native 1440p displays. macOS rendering at non-integer scaling produces inferior text quality compared to Windows. The Dell P2423D works because it's used at native resolution (not scaled), which bypasses this limitation entirely.

### Thunderbolt Integration Matters
Native Thunderbolt 4 (ViewSonic) or Thunderbolt 3 (LG) eliminate the "adapter tax" that USB-C solutions require. Community consensus: Single-cable charging + video + data creates meaningful workflow improvement for creative professionals but less relevant for productivity-only users.

### Secondary Display Strategy Confirmed
Community feedback confirms ultrawide + 24" secondary is an emerging best-practice setup. The 24-inch secondary becomes the "focus monitor" while ultrawide handles "scope monitoring." Community pattern: Users report ultrawide excels at timelines/spreadsheets but 24" dedicated screen better for text-heavy work.

### Mac Display Limits Unknown
Multiple communities note many Mac users unaware of external display limits: M1/M2 Macs support only one external display, M3+ Macs support two. Verify your Mac generation before multi-display setup.

## Community Red Flags & Controversies

**Scaling Regression Post-Ventura:** Users report loss of manual scaling options on 4K monitors after Ventura update. Community workaround: Apps like BetterDisplay provide scaling options, but not native solution.

**Power Delivery False Marketing:** Many monitors advertise USB-C with power delivery but provide only 30W (insufficient for Mac charging). Always verify power specs - ASUS PA247CV is example of false advertising (no power delivery despite USB-C).

**DisplayPort/HDMI Confusion:** Community complaint patterns show users confused about adapter requirements. Not all USB-C monitors have DP Alt Mode. Always verify native Mac connectivity specifications.

**Thunderbolt 4 Supply Tightening:** Multiple 2025 discussions note Thunderbolt 4 24" monitors becoming rarer. ViewSonic VP2488-4K and LG 24UP550-W both described as "inventory declining."

**Import Variability to Denmark:** Community members report some monitors from certain retailers ship with US-spec power adapters (110V only). Always verify "100-240V universal" notation on power brick.

## Community Buying Recommendations by Profile

**For Developers/Productivity (Best Value):**
Community consensus: Dell P2423D (Cost-Benefit tier). Reasoning: QHD resolution perfect for code editing, USB hub reduces cable clutter, Thunderbolt not essential. Verdict: "Don't overpay for Thunderbolt if just coding."

**For Photographers/Designers (Creative Priority):**
Community consensus: ViewSonic VP2488-4K (Premium-Entrance tier). Reasoning: 4K + Thunderbolt 4 + Pantone validation creates professional-grade setup. Community pattern: "Single Thunderbolt cable is game-changer for Mac workflow."

**For Budget-Conscious Secondary Display:**
Community consensus: BenQ EW2480 (Budget tier). With caveat: only adequate for reference/auxiliary workspace. Pattern advice: "Don't expect stunning color, but reliable for secondary duty."

**For Maximum Value (Premium Entrance Budget Flexible):**
Community consensus: ViewSonic VP2488-4K if budget permits, Dell P2423D as fallback. Community insight: "ViewSonic premium justifiable only if keeping monitor 4+ years and doing creative work frequently."

## Community Sentiment Summary

**Strongest Community Consensus:** Dell P2423D represents best smart value in market. Cited across MacRumors, Apple Community, and Hacker News as "where intelligent buying happens."

**Most Recommended for Mac-Native Integration:** ViewSonic VP2488-4K praised for true Mac integration, but community notes supply becoming limited and price premium significant for non-color-critical work.

**Growing Consensus on Secondary Display Strategy:** Mac community increasingly confirms ultrawide + 24" secondary as productive workflow pattern. Investment in quality secondary justified since "you'll spend focused time there."

**Cautionary Note:** True 24" premium monitors increasingly rare market-wide (2025). Professional market shifted to 27"+ formats. Users seeking premium 24" should act quickly - selection declining.

## P2P MARKETPLACE - 24" 4K Monitors (Denmark)

**Research Date:** November 10, 2025
**Platforms Searched:** DBA.dk, Facebook Marketplace Denmark, Tradera, Blocket
**Key Finding:** True 24-inch 4K monitors (3840x2160) are essentially unavailable in Danish P2P marketplaces

### Budget Tier
- No listings found

### Cost-Benefit Tier
- No listings found

### Premium-Entrance Tier
- No listings found

### Premium Tier
- No listings found

### Market Analysis

**Why the Scarcity:**
- Niche professional product: 24" 4K monitors target creative professionals who typically keep monitors or donate to studios rather than resell
- Industry trend: Market has moved to 27"+ for 4K, making 24" even more specialized
- Limited production: Only handful of manufacturers produce true 24" 4K (ViewSonic VP2488-4K, LG 24UP550-W, some BenQ models)
- Low second-hand volume: Professional monitors rarely appear on used marketplaces

**Recommendation:** For 24" 4K monitors, purchase new from retailers (Danish retailers, cross-border, or international markets) rather than relying on P2P platforms. P2P markets better suited for 24" 1440p or 1080p alternatives.
