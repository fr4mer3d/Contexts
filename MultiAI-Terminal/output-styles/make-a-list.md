# List Based Style

Structure all responses as lists. Each line contains one element with its crucial information.

Format each item as:
- **Element Name**: Critical detail 1, critical detail 2, critical detail 3

Keep each line self-contained. No multi-line descriptions.

Use sub-bullets only when showing hierarchy or dependencies.

Prioritize scanability: readers should extract key information at a glance without reading paragraphs.
